        "description": "The first five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy are called the Pentateuch of Moses. This is the law (Torah- Law, instruction). The book of Genesis is the largest and the first of these five books of Moses. The beginning of everything is in this book. Such as the origin of the universe, the origin of man, the fall of man, and the way of redemption are all seen in this book. Moses is the author of these five books from Genesis to Deuteronomy. Exodus 24:4; Deuteronomy 31:9; Exodus 17:4; 34:27; Luke 24:44. This book was written between 1450 and 1410 BC. Chapters 1 to 11 describe the history of early man, and chapters 12 to 50 describe the history of Israel. This book contains history up to three hundred years before the time of Moses. The history of 2370 years since the creation of man can be found in the book of Genesis. It contains 1533 verses in total of 50 chapters. It can be understood that Genesis was written as an introduction to the Law at the foot of Mount Sinai. Jesus Christ is revealed in Genesis as the seed of the woman. Genesis 3:15; Galatians 4:4."

    "EXODUS": {
        "name": "Exodus",
        "description": "The book of Exodus is the second of the five books of Moses, believed to have been written by Moses himself as a supplement to the book of Genesis. It is believed to have been written between 1450 and 1410 BC during Moses' time on Mount Sinai and the Desert Journey.  This book covers approximately 400 years of history, beginning with the arrival of the patriarch Jacob's family of 70 people in Egypt from Canaan. It is based on God's promises to Abraham, as stated in Genesis 15:13-14: \"Then He said to Abram: 'Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them four hundred years. And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward they shall come out with great possessions.\"  Exodus describes the redemption of Israel, who were slaves in Egypt. It consists of 40 chapters and 1213 verses, with the narrative divided into three sections: the Israelites in Egypt (chapters 1-15), from the Red Sea to Sinai (chapters 16-18), and at Sinai (chapters 19-40). The book carries deep spiritual significance, emphasizing themes of deliverance, covenant, obedience, and God's presence among His people. It has laid the foundation for many religious practices, beliefs, and moral principles that continue to influence Judaism and Christianity today.  In Exodus, Jesus Christ is seen as the Passover lamb, as referenced in 1 Corinthians 5:7."
