# Paivot Project - Current Status

## Overview

This document outlines the current status of the Paivot project, including the architecture, hosting setup, and known issues.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API

### Backend
- **Authentication**: Supabase Authentication
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (for user uploads)

### Hosting
- **Platform**: AWS Amplify
- **Domain**: rid.paivot.net
- **Branch**: rid

## Current Setup

### Supabase Integration
The project uses Supabase for authentication and data storage:

- **Authentication**: Email/password and social login (Google, Apple, LinkedIn)
- **User Profiles**: Stored in Supabase profiles table
- **Data Access**: Client-side access via Supabase client

### AWS Amplify Hosting
The application is hosted on AWS Amplify, which provides:

- **CI/CD**: Automatic deployments from GitHub
- **Environment Variables**: Configured in the Amplify Console
- **Domain Management**: Custom domain setup with SSL

## Known Issues

### 1. Authentication Flow
- Social login redirects need to be properly configured in Supabase
- User profile creation sometimes fails after signup
- Role-based access control needs refinement

### 2. Deployment Challenges
- Environment variables must be properly set in AWS Amplify Console
- Build failures can occur if dependencies are not properly cleaned up
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering) requires special handling for browser APIs

### 3. Code Organization
- Some components may still reference removed authentication systems
- API routes need to be updated to use Supabase instead of direct database access
- Type definitions may need updates for Supabase user objects

## Recent Changes

- Removed NextAuth.js, Prisma, and AWS Cognito dependencies
- Simplified to use only Supabase for authentication and data storage
- Updated environment configuration for Supabase
- Cleaned up unused files and dependencies

## Next Steps

### Short-term
1. Verify all authentication flows work correctly with Supabase
2. Ensure proper error handling for authentication edge cases
3. Update any remaining components that might reference old auth systems

### Medium-term
1. Implement proper data models in Supabase
2. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
3. Optimize build and deployment process

### Long-term
1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Implement analytics
3. Enhance user experience with additional features

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment, you need:

1. Supabase project with:
   - Authentication enabled
   - Database tables for user data
   - Storage buckets configured

2. AWS Amplify with:
   - GitHub repository connected
   - Environment variables configured:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `SITE_URL`
     - `COOKIE_DOMAIN`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Check AWS Amplify logs for specific error messages
- Verify all environment variables are correctly set
- Ensure dependencies are properly cleaned up

### Authentication Issues
- Check Supabase authentication settings
- Verify redirect URLs are correctly configured
- Check browser console for client-side errors
